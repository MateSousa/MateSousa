## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

This is Matheus! I'm currently working as a DevOps Engineer. My tech stack includes Linux, Networking Fundamentals, Programming (Bash & Python), Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform, EFK, Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic and others.

What excites me about DevOps is the possibility to work with complex infrastructures, but automate pretty much everything on top of it ðŸ§¡.
